|                            |    barrel of rainwater is in the center of the clearing.  This looks like a great place
|                            |    to camp.  There are thick bushes to the south.  An old hollow tree sits to the east,
|                            |    just outside of the clearing.

|                            |    as well, which drips water into a bucket -- annoying.

The mace of smiting was crafted for the Holy Order cleric Rath many years
ago.  It is believed that the mace was an act of charity in return for the
many charitable offerings he had given to those in need.  The mages that had
originally enchanted it were lost to history, but Rath's fate was detailed.
The mace helped him in the fight against many an undead foe before he was
finally slain.  The mace itself fell where he died and stayed there for many
years.  The undead that killed him dared not touch a holy artifact.  It
wasn't until an adventurer fleeing for his life come through this tomb came
across the weapon that it resurfaced into the world.  It is believed he
traded it with a Palanthian merchant for a few gems.  The mace has moved
through owners rapidly since.
It is made out of silver and some energy.
It is in perfect condition.
It weighs about 7 pounds.
It is marked as not for sale.
