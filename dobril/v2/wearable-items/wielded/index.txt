The dagger of vengeance has held many names since its mysterious
crafting.  Likewise, it has also held many owners.  And by held, held can be
taken literally, it is said that the dagger itself can possess its owner.
Once possessed the owner is powerless to control his or her own actions.
The history is deep, but it is believed the kender Twigpuckle originally
discovered it.  It caused him to hate both friend and foe without little
reguard.  Once relieved of the item, it quickly jumped hand to hand as its
possessors would usually get killed after so many murders.  The last known
possessor was an evil dwarf named Guidonious.  Stories still circle about
his insatiable lust for cruelty and acts of evil.  No one knows how he lost
the dagger or where he himself is, but fear still seeps in the hearts of
those wandering dark, lonely alleyways.
It is made out of silver and some wood.
It is in perfect condition.
It weighs about 5 pounds.
