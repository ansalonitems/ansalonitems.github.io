Opening up the flap, you can see what looks like an armory inside!
Hundreds of swords, axes, spears, daggers, maces, even polearms seem to be
inside, many glowing and humming with obvious magical power!  You try to
reach inside (just to see if it's all real of course) and the pack
twists around in your grasp and closes itself up with an audible *snick*.
Jair's backpack holds:
( 2) (Plastic) an Easter egg

a diamond slat
