Easa the Witch frowns suddenly.
Easa the Witch begins to itch her scalp beneath her wide brimmed hat.
Easa the Witch swears : #@*"*&^*#%@*&! !!!!!
Easa the Witch seems to root around for something.
Easa the Witch removes an enormous  rat from within her tangled hair.
Easa the Witch exclaims 'Begone! You spawn of Chemosh!'
Easa the Witch grumbles angerly, and holds the rat aloft by its tail.
Easa the Witch exclaims ''These are treacherous places to dwell if you wish your life intact, you demon welped abysmal creature!'
Easa the Witch tosses the rat onto the floor, nudging it away with her foot.
The rat scurries off, disapearing beneath the tent flap and out into the faire.
You stop using a leather emblem.
You hold Easa's Eye in your hand.
